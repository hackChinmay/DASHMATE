Delivery  app where a person acts as consumers as well as delivery partner
Imagine this:
What if you could get food, books, stationery (like pens, notebooks), or even small things from shops inside or nearby campus delivered to you, without leaving your place? You’d pay a small delivery fee, and a fellow student would bring the stuff directly to you! Convenient, right?

Here’s the basic idea of the service:

		You place an order
  Its basically a plan of delivery services inside the campus and amongst the student.
Here’s the basic idea of the service:
		You place an order for something from a on campus shop or food outlet.
		Another student (who’s already walking around campus) picks it up and delivers it to you.
		The student who delivers you an order gets a reward point which he can use it for his order to get delivered.
		You should have reward point to place the order or you will have to pay the delivery charge.
                For the income of the platform every order placed will have a small convenience fees and we will charge some fees from shops.
		For appreciation, the top 10 points collectors from the campus will get some cash reward or gift from us.
		
This will help all the students to get the item conveniently and will also increase the social connect among the students.
